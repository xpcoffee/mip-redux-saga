# mip-redux-saga

This is a minimal project (mip) for [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org). The primary goal of the repo is to learn this library.

## Fetching IP data

This project calls against https://api.myip.com to display the user's current IP. This is done via an HTTP proxy, configured in [setupProxy.js](./src/setupProxy.js).
